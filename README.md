# TextToVoice
The Text To Voice Converter generates spoken words from written text and provides a variety of voice options with different accents. It also allows users to save and load specific text. This program was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you have any suggestions.
